Description The Temporary Foreign Worker Program (TFWP) is using the provincial/territorial median hourly wage to set program requirements by stream. The specific requirements an employer must follow will be determined by the wage being offered for the position, in relation to the provincial/territorial median hourly wage, based on Statistics Canada's Labour Force Survey. Employers offering a wage to a TFW that is below the provincial/territorial median hourly wage will be subject to all of the requirements of the Stream for Low-wage Positions. It is important to note, that the TFWP uses the National Occupational Classification (NOC) codes to determine the prevailing wage and to ensure that the appropriate job requirements and duties are used for the occupation. After employers have determined whether they are hiring a TFW for a low-wage position or a high-wage position, they must ensure that they meet all of the requirements for that stream including meeting the prevailing wage requirement. Under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), there are special circumstances when: employers are exempt from requiring a Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) from Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC)/Service Canada to hire a TFW; or TFWs are exempt from requiring a work permit issued by Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC).

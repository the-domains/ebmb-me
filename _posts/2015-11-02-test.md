Changing the background Let's take a look at how we can customize the background of a particular page or spread or of the entire book project. To do that, what I want to do is open up the guides panel and then for a moment let's turn off the visibility of the guides, then let's collect to expand the background panel. In the background panel, we have some controls which allows us to apply background changes globally or do we make changes in this way. It will apply a change to the entire project. For example, if we choose a new background color here by clicking on the background color option. And then if we click on the color chip and if we choose a different color, for example, lets say we want to choose something that has perhaps a little bit of color in it, you can see how all of the pages now have this color in their background.
